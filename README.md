# Detection-and-Characterization-of-Darknet-Traffic-using-Attention-LSTM-with-XAI

## Overview
The research presents an innovative approach that efficiently categorizes encrypted network flows associated with darknet traffic using an attention-based LSTM technique. The comprehensive pre-processing, attention LSTM model, and LIME XAI technique contribute to the system's high performance in detecting and characterizing Darknet traffic.The results are remarkable, with a detection accuracy of 99.70% for Darknet traffic and 97% for classifying the nature of Darknet operations.
